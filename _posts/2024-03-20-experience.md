Hello! I’m Iordanis, and I’m happy to welcome you to my personal website. 
I created this website to share my journey, research, and informal insights in the fields of hearing technology, deep learning, and audio processing. Here, you will find information about my academic background, professional experiences, and ongoing projects. I aim to foster collaboration and discussion around innovative solutions for hearing loss and audio signal processing. I invite you to explore my work, and I’m always open to discussing potential research collaborations. If you have any questions or would like to connect, please feel free to reach out!
